        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="mypic.jpg" width="150" />
        <p>
          I am a highly motivated and experienced software engineer with a
          strong background in .NET and Angular, as well as a fundamental
          understanding of various programming languages. My primary goal is to
          leverage my four years of professional experience to contribute
          effectively to innovative software projects while continuously
          nurturing my professional growth. My technical skills encompass a
          diverse range of programming languages and tools, including .NET Core,
          C#, Angular, SQL, Ionic, JQuery, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MAUI, AWS,
          Node.js, React.js, and Python. I am also well-versed in Agile software
          development practices and have hands-on experience with essential
          software tools such as Git, GitHub, Jira, Trello, Bitbucket, and
          MS-Office.
        </p>
        <p>
          These skills, combined with my knack for problem-solving, quick
          learning ability, and strong communication and leadership skills,
          enable me to excel in dynamic and collaborative work environments. In
          my previous roles as a Senior Software Engineer at Resimator and
          Whitehat Engineering, I have successfully contributed to the
          development of commercial websites and software solutions,
          demonstrating proficiency in Angular, .NET, and SQL. I have also taken
          on responsibilities in research and architecture design, showcasing my
          adaptability and innovative thinking. My experience at Verisk further
          expanded my skill set, offering opportunities to work on full-stack
          software projects, gain expertise in AWS, and mentor junior team
          members, thereby enhancing my leadership and communication skills.
          With a strong foundation in computer engineering, along with a minor
          and major project experience, I am ready to make significant
          contributions to cutting-edge software development projects and seek
          an opportunity to further my career in a challenging and collaborative
          software engineering role.
